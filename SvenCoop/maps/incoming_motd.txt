Somewhere in the deserts of the U.S.

After the residence cascade of the Black Mesa Research Facility, the superiors of the smaller mesa research facilities have grown increasingly paranoid towards their defence systems. Their defence systems can only go to a certain limit of effectiveness. The superiors of the smaller mesa facilities, under the pressure of military "clean-outs" following the black mesa incident, have decided to hire defence squads to further the chances of successful military resistance.

You and your teammates have just been hired to defend a small facility not too far away from the black mesa facility. Things seem to be in order... so far...
