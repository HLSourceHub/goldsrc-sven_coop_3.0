<font color="#AFBAC9" size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial">
<img src="images/note.jpg" width="51" height="17"> A full list of the changes 
can be found <b><a href="changes.html">HERE</a></b>.</font><p>

<font color="#AFBAC9" size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial">Version 3.0 is one of the 
most major updates in Sven Co-op's history. Not only including new monsters, 
maps and weapons, it also greatly improves the AI and adds features and 
enhancements too numerous to list here... The purpose of this page is to 
summarize some of the most important features for those who don't have time to 
read the full <a href="changes.html">features/changes list</a>, or would prefer 
to jump into the game and discover the new features for themselves.</font><p>

<font color="#AFBAC9" size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial">A lot more emphasis has been placed on NPC allies 
in 3.0, with the ability for everything from ally grunts to 'friendly' aliens, from pet Headcrabs to your very own Gargantua, to follow players and be given simple orders (More on this in the the NPC 
Allies section). The OP4 Grunts have also been added, including medic grunts who can heal their comrades; be they players, tame aliens, or black ops snipers. 
<p>The bad guys have been boosted with their own nasty version of the Op4 grunts, as well as the Voltigore, a Race X creature with a strong shell and powerful attacks. In addition, their improved AI and brand new abilities make the game far more challenging.</font><p>

<font color="#AFBAC9" size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial">The player's arsenal has been improved by addition of long range and assault weapons -- a Sniper Rifle and a Minigun.<br> 
The Barnacle Grapple from Opposing Force has also been added, which will allow players to pull themselves up to higher ledges or gently drop down high distances. Keep in mind that the barnacle can only attach itself to organic surfaces, players, and some monsters.</font><p>

<font color="#AFBAC9" size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial">3.0 also features a system we call 'MADWHACK Physics'. Explosions and shotgun blasts send monsters flying through the air... monsters take falling damage and are damaged by players or monsters falling upon them from high above (as are players)... monster corpses float in water and lie flat on sloped ground... etc. etc. Players can even potentially ride around on 
Bullsquid, or glide through the air atop player-allied Alien Controllers.<p>
The system also applies to weapons. Dropped weapons bounce and slide appropriately, weapons can be thrown to other players and caught in mid-air, etc.</font><p>

<font color="#AFBAC9" size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial">The visual appeal of the mod has also been improved, with new High Definition models being added for a range of monsters.</font><p>

<font color="#AFBAC9" size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial">As for level designers, the addition of features like global cameras (allowing in-game cut-scenes), per-entity Sound Replacement, being able to assign monsters to specific factions and the ability for monsters to randomly roam around a map means that more random, varied levels should start to turn up as a result of this release.</font><p>

<font color="#AFBAC9" size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial">All in all, this version of Sven Co-op introduces a lot of new and fun elements to the game that we've wished to add for a long time. A lot of work has been put into this version of the mod and we hope that it meets up to expectations.</blockquote></blockquote></font><p>
